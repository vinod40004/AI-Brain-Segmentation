## Brain Tumor Segmentation and Statistical Analysis

This project focuses on brain tumor segmentation using MRI images. It utilizes a 3D U-Net model trained on the BraTS 2020 dataset for multi-class segmentation and performs statistical analysis on tumor volumes. The key outputs include segmentation maps, heatmaps, and volume comparisons.
